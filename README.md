# pyprojects
practice python projects from 'learn python 3 the hard way'

# how much
There are over 50 .py files in the book.

# Reason
still learning git, git hub, and python 
my previous OS malfunction (my bad) and had to install new OS.
All python files was deleted and forgot to backup to phone. 
so, I have heard Git VCS for a long time and never used before and
i relised Git will be a relief if that case happens again.
